  "abstract": "<p>NetKAT is a domain-specific language and logic for specifying and verifying network packet-processing functions. It consists of Kleene algebra with tests (KAT) augmented with primitives for testing and modifying packet headers and encoding network topologies. Previous work developed the design of the language and its standard semantics, proved the soundness and completeness of the logic, defined a PSPACE algorithm for deciding equivalence, and presented several practical applications.</p><p>This paper develops the coalgebraic theory of NetKAT, including a specialized version of the Brzozowski derivative, and presents a new efficient algorithm for deciding the equational theory using bisimulation. The coalgebraic structure admits an efficient sparse representation that results in a significant reduction in the size of the state space. We discuss the details of our implementation and optimizations that exploit NetKAT\"s equational axioms and coalgebraic structure to yield significantly improved performance. We present results from experiments demonstrating that our tool is competitive with state-of-the-art tools on several benchmarks including all-pairs connectivity, loop-freedom, and translation validation.</p>",

  "abstract": "<p>The Chomsky hierarchy plays a prominent role in the foundations of the theoretical computer science relating classes of formal languages of primary importance. In this paper we use recent developments on coalgebraic and monad-based semantics to obtain a generic notion of a T-automaton, where T is a monad, which allows the uniform study of various notions of machines (e.g. finite state machines, multi-stack machines, Turing machines, valence automata, weighted automata). We use the generalized powerset construction to define a generic (trace) semantics for T-automata, and we show by numerous examples that it correctly instantiates for the known classes of machines/languages captured by the Chomsky hierarchy. Moreover, our approach provides new generic techniques for proving expressivity bounds of various machine-based models.</p>",

The quest herein is to provide constructs for composition of building blocks and semantic models thereof which enable both analyses and allow for modeling and verification.</p><p>Stochastic Reo offers constructs for component and service coordination and provides means for specification of stochastic values for software connectors. Interactive Markov chains (IMC) on the other hand, are a stochastic, compositional, extension of classical models of concurrency, integrating classical and stochastic aspects.</p><p>This paper discusses how IMC can be effectively used as a compositional semantic model for Stochastic Reo, avoiding to resort to a separate automaton model, often lacking full compositionality, as intermediate semantics. A tool chain integrating available tool support for IMC, is described and applied in the analysis of a case study dealing with performance and resource allocation of a mediation system.</p>",

  "abstract": "<p>This paper takes a fresh look at the topic of trace semantics in the theory of coalgebras. In the last few years, two approaches, somewhat incomparable at first sight, captured successfully in a coalgebraic setting trace semantics for various types of transition systems. The first development of coalgebraic trace semantics used final coalgebras in Kleisli categories and required some non-trivial assumptions, which do not always hold, even in cases where one can reasonably speak of traces (like for weighted automata). The second development stemmed from the observation that trace semantics can also arise by performing a determinization construction and used final coalgebras in Eilenberg-Moore categories. In this paper, we develop a systematic study in which the two approaches can be studied and compared. Notably, we show that the two different views on trace semantics are equivalent, in the examples where both approaches are applicable.</p>",

  "abstract": "<p>In concurrency theory, various semantic equivalences on transition systems are based on traces decorated with some additional observations, generally referred to as decorated traces. Using the generalized powerset construction, recently introduced by a subset of the authors, we give a coalgebraic presentation of decorated trace semantics. The latter include ready, failure, (complete) trace, possible-futures, ready trace and failure trace semantics for labeled transition systems, and ready, (maximal) failure and (maximal) trace semantics for generative probabilistic systems.  This yields a uniform notion of minimal representatives for the various decorated trace equivalences, in terms of final Moore automata. As a consequence, proofs of decorated trace equivalence can be given by coinduction, using different types of (Moore-) bisimulation (up-to context).</p>",

More broadly, our approach extends the standard coalgebraic framework for state-based systems by taking into account the algebraic structure of the labels of their transitions. This allows to consider a wide range of other examples, including Mazurkiewicz traces for concurrent systems.</p>",

Stochastic Reo offers constructs for service coordination and allows the specification of stochastic values for channels. But its state-of-the-art semantic models fail in several (important) ways. In this paper, we will see how Interactive Markov chains (IMC), proposed as a stochastic compositional model of concurrency, can be effectively used to serve as a compositional semantic model for Stochastic Reo. Treating IMC as a direct semantic model, gives rise to more faithful models and has obvious efficiency advantages. Moreover, tool support that exists for IMC is made available, without significant effort, to verify and reason about the coordination layer modelled as Reo connectors.</p>",
