            <p>I am a Professor of Algebra, Semantics, and Computation at the <a href="http://pplv.cs.ucl.ac.uk">Programming Principles, Logic and Verification Group</a>, <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk">University College London</a>.</p>
            <p>From September 2011 to August 2015, I was a (tenured) assistant professor at the <a href="http://www.ru.nl/foundations">Foundations group</a> in the <a href="http://www.ru.nl/icis/">Institute for Computing and Information Science</a> of the <a href="http://www.ru.nl/">Radboud University Nijmegen</a> (The Netherlands). During that time, I was a visitor at the CWI <a href="http://www.cwi.nl/en/research-groups/Foundations-of-software-engineering">Foundations of software engineering group</a> and a member of <a href="http://haslab.di.uminho.pt">HASLab</a>, the University of Minho's High-Assurance Software Laboratory.</p>
            <p>From September 2010 to August 2011, I was a post-doc at the <a href="http://www.cwi.nl/en/research-groups/Foundations-of-software-engineering">Foundations of software engineering group</a>, at the <a href="http://www.cwi.nl/">CWI</a>, in Amsterdam. During that period, I spent some wonderful months in Ithaca visiting <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kozen/"> Dexter Kozen</a> at Cornell University.</p>
            <p>Until September 2010, I was a happy PhD student at the <a href="http://www.cwi.nl/">CWI</a> under the great supervision of <a href="http://www.cwi.nl/~janr">Jan Rutten</a> and <a href="http://www.liacs.nl/~marcello">Marcello Bonsangue</a>. My thesis, entitled <em>Kleene coalgebra</em>, was defended on the 21st December 2010 at the Radboud University, in Nijmegen (see <a title="Thesis" href="/#/thesis.html">here</a> for more info about my thesis).</p>
            <p>Before, I was a graduate student at <a href="http://www.uminho.pt/">University of Minho</a> (Braga, Portugal). I completed my 5-year Maths and Computer Science degree in May 2006. My final project, <a href="/files/report.pdf">Strong Types for Relational Data Stored in Databases or Spreadsheets</a>, was supervised by <a href="http://www.di.uminho.pt/~jno">J.N.Oliveira</a> and <a href="http://www.di.uminho.pt/~joostvisser">Joost Visser</a>.</p>
